# EduBuddy Chapter Limit Fix

## Problem Identified

The EduBuddy platform was only showing 5 chapters for lessons despite configuring the AI to generate 10-15 chapters. This was due to a limitation in the `ai-edu-content` function that was explicitly requesting only 5-7 chapters.

## Solution Implemented

We fixed this issue by updating both AI content generation functions to consistently request 10-15 chapters:

1. **Updated AI Prompts in Both Functions:**
   - Modified `supabase/functions/ai-edu-content/index.ts` to request 10-15 chapters instead of 5-7
   - Increased word count per chapter from 300-500 to 400-600 words
   - Increased fun facts from 5 to 8-10 facts
   - Made conclusion and summary sections more comprehensive

2. **Upgraded AI Model:**
   - Changed from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-4o` for better content quality
   - Increased `max_tokens` to 7000 to handle the longer content
   - Updated both English and Indonesian prompts for consistency

3. **Extended Lesson Duration:**
   - Changed expected reading/engagement time from 10-15 minutes to 60-90 minutes
   - Added word count guidelines for conclusion (250-350 words) and summary (300-400 words)

## Benefits

1. **More Comprehensive Lessons:**
   - Lessons now include all 10-15 chapters generated by the AI
   - Each chapter contains more detailed content (400-600 words)
   - Students get more in-depth coverage of topics (60-90 minute lessons)

2. **Better Educational Experience:**
   - More fun facts and examples for better engagement
   - More thorough conclusions and summaries for reinforced learning
   - Higher quality content from the improved AI model

## How to Test

1. Reset your lesson content using the reset script:
   ```bash
   ./reset_lessons.sh
   ```

2. Generate a new lesson and verify:
   - Lesson contains 10-15 chapters instead of just 5
   - Chapters have more comprehensive content
   - Fun facts, conclusion, and summary sections are more detailed

3. No code changes are needed in the frontend components, as they were already designed to handle variable numbers of chapters.

This fix ensures that all AI-generated content is consistently comprehensive and delivers the full learning experience we designed for students.
