# EduBuddy Additional Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Image Search Failures**
   - Fixed CORS issues by replacing external API calls with local image generation
   - Removed Google API and SerpAPI methods that were failing with errors
   - Implemented more reliable, deterministic placeholder image generation
   - Added color variety to make placeholder images more visually distinct

2. **Content Generation Adjustments**
   - Fixed unrealistic content requirements (50-150 chapters, 40000-60000 words per chapter)
   - Reverted to more reasonable 10-15 chapters with 400-600 words per chapter
   - Increased the AI max_tokens from 4000 to 7000 to allow for richer content
   - Updated the system prompt to reflect the 60-90 minute lesson duration

## Implementation Details

1. **Image Generation Solution**
   - Replaced all external API calls with DiceBear API for consistent placeholder images
   - Created a wider variety of visually distinct placeholder images using different color schemes
   - Implemented better error handling to prevent image loading failures
   - Made placeholder images more deterministic so the same search terms get the same images

2. **AI Prompt Optimization**
   - Corrected the capitalization of "Challenge questions" for consistency
   - Maintained the detailed requirements for fun facts, activities, examples, etc.
   - Kept the same structure but with more realistic content expectations
   - Increased token limit to allow the AI to generate more comprehensive content

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes, you should:

1. Run the migration script to fix database schema issues:
   ```bash
   supabase db execute --file migration_fix_lesson_progress.sql
   ```

2. Restart your application to apply all changes

3. Monitor for any remaining issues with:
   - Image loading
   - Database connections
   - AI content generation

These fixes should resolve the 400 Bad Request errors and CORS issues while ensuring lessons are generated with a reasonable amount of content.
