                  This platform was dreamed up by an 11-year-old 4th grader named Danish Adlanahza Hartono. Danish noticed something troubling: many kids today are more excited about mobile games than learning new things. While games are fun, Danish believes that too much screen time without learning can lead to what he calls "brainrot" â€” where our minds forget how to grow and explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's why this educational platform was born â€” a fun, smart, and interactive learning space made by a kid, for kids. It helps students learn useful subjects like Math, Science, and English, all through games, quizzes, and exciting AI-powered lessons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it's not just for kids â€” it's also built for the new generation of parents. Using AI, parents and teachers can monitor each child's progress, see detailed reports, and understand how their kids are learning â€” almost like having a virtual teacher assistant by their side!
